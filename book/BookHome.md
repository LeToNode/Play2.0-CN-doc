Play 2.0 is a high-productivity Java and Scala web application framework that integrates the components and APIs you need for modern web application development. 

Play is based on a lightweight, stateless, web-friendly architecture and features predictable and minimal resource consumption (CPU, memory, threads) for highly-scalable applications, thanks to its reactive model, based on Iteratee IO.
