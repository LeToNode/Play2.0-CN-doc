# Working with JSON

The recommend way of dealing with JSON in a play app is using Play's Json library. Play's JSON library was inspired by SJSON's Typeclass based JSON serialization but it was in fact built on top of [Jerkson](https://github.com/codahale/jerkson/).

If the typeclass based solution is not desirable for any reason, one can always fall back to [Jerkson](https://github.com/codahale/jerkson/) which is bundled with Play.
