# Deploying to Heroku

[[Heroku | http://www.heroku.com/]] is a cloud application platform – a new way of building and deploying web apps.

## Add the Procfile　

Heroku requires a special file in the application root called `Procfile`. Create a simple text file with the following content:

```txt
web: target/start -Dhttp.port=${PORT} ${JAVA_OPTS}
```

## Store your application in git

Just create a git repository for your application:

```bash
$ git init
$ git add .
$ git commit -m "init"
```

## Create a new application on Heroku

> Note that you need an Heroku account, and to install the heroku gem.

```bash
$ heroku create --stack cedar
Creating warm-frost-1289... done, stack is cedar
http://warm-1289.herokuapp.com/ | git@heroku.com:warm-1289.git
Git remote heroku added
```

## Deploy your application

To deploy your application on Heroku, just use git to push it into the `heroku` remote repository:

```bash
$ git push heroku master
Counting objects: 34, done.
Delta compression using up to 8 threads.
Compressing objects: 100% (20/20), done.
Writing objects: 100% (34/34), 35.45 KiB, done.
Total 34 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0)

       http://8044.herokuapp.com deployed to Heroku

To git@heroku.com:floating-lightning-8044.git
* [new branch]      master -> master
```

Heroku will run `sbt clean compile stage` to prepare your application. On the first deployment, all dependencies will be downloaded, which takes a while to complete (but will be cached for future deployments).

## Check that your application has been deployed

Now, let’s check the state of the application’s processes:

```bash
$ heroku ps
Process       State               Command
------------  ------------------  ----------------------
web.1         up for 10s          target/start 
```

The web process is up. Review the logs for more information:

```bash
$ heroku logs
2011-08-18T00:13:41+00:00 heroku[web.1]: Starting process with command `target/start`
2011-08-18T00:14:18+00:00 app[web.1]: Starting on port:28328
2011-08-18T00:14:18+00:00 app[web.1]: Started.
2011-08-18T00:14:19+00:00 heroku[web.1]: State changed from starting to up
...
```

Looks good. We can now visit the app with `heroku open`.

## Running play commands remotely

Cedar allows you to launch a REPL process attached to your local terminal for experimenting in your application’s environment:

```bash
$ heroku run sbt play
Running sbt play attached to terminal... up, run.2
[info] Loading global plugins from /app/.sbt_home/.sbt/plugins
[info] Updating {file:/app/.sbt_home/.sbt/plugins/}default-0f55ac...
[info] Set current project to My first application (in build file:/app/)

[My first application] $
```

## Finetuning

Even for simple apps, the heroku slug size will soon exceed 100MB, which is the allowed range.
The reason is the .ivy cache that is included in the slug. You can easily overcome that using your own custom heroku "build pack". A build pack is a bunch of scripts stored in a remote git repository. The are fetched and executed at compile time. The original build pack is available here: https://github.com/heroku/heroku-buildpack-scala.

You simply fork it on github and change the ```bin/compile``` script towards its end:
```
...
mkdir -p $CACHE_DIR
for DIR in $CACHED_DIRS ; do
  rm -rf $CACHE_DIR/$DIR
  mkdir -p $CACHE_DIR/$DIR
  cp -r $DIR/.  $CACHE_DIR/$DIR
echo "-----> Dropping ivy cache from the slug: $DIR"
rm -rf $SBT_USER_HOME/.ivy2
done
```

Using the same tool, you can overcome another problem: On heroku, the scala template compilation needs the UTF8 encoding to be explicitly set. Simply change that in your build pack like that:
```
...
# build app
echo "-----> Running: sbt $SBT_TASKS"
test -e "$SBT_BINDIR"/sbt.boot.properties && PROPS_OPTION="-Dsbt.boot.properties=$SBT_BINDIR/sbt.boot.properties"
HOME="$SBT_USER_HOME_ABSOLUTE" java -Xmx512M -Dfile.encoding=UTF8 -Duser.home="$SBT_USER_HOME_ABSOLUTE" -Divy.default.ivy.user.dir="$SBT_USER_HOME_ABSOLUTE/.ivy2" $PROPS_OPTION -jar "$SBT_BINDIR"/$SBT_JAR $SBT_TASKS 2>&1 | sed -u 's/^/       /'
if [ "${PIPESTATUS[*]}" != "0 0" ]; then
  echo " !     Failed to build app with SBT $SBT_VERSION"
  exit 1
fi
...
```

Here you can find an example of a working build pack: https://github.com/joergviola/heroku-buildpack-scala.

Last step: Add the build pack address as a config var to heroku:
```
heroku config:add BUILDPACK_URL='git@github.com:joergviola/heroku-buildpack-scala.git'
```
