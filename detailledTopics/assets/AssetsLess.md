# Using LESS CSS

[[LESS CSS | http://lesscss.org/]] is a dynamic stylesheet language. It allows greater flexibility in the way you write CSS files: including support for variables, mixins and more.

Compilable assets in Play 2.0 must be defined in the `app/assets` directory. They are handled by the build process, and LESS sources are compiled into standard CSS files. The generated CSS files are distributed as standard resources into the same `public/` folder as the unmanaged assets, meaning that there is no difference in the way you use them once compiled.

> Note that managed resources are not copied directly into your application `public` folder, but maintained in a separate folder in `target/scala-2.9.1/resources_managed`.

For example a LESS source file at `app/assets/stylesheets/main.less` will be available as a standard resource at `public/stylesheets/main.css`.

LESS sources are compiled automatically during a `compile` command, or when you refresh any page in your browser while you are running in development mode. Any compilation errors will be displayed in your browser:

## Working with partial LESS source files

You can split your LESS source into several libraries, and use the LESS `import` feature. 

To prevent library files from being compiled individually (or imported) we need them to be skipped by the compiler. To do this, partial source files must be prefixed with the underscore (`_`) character, for example: `_myLibrary.less`. To configure this behavior, see the _Configuration_ section at the end of this page.

## Layout

Here is an example layout for using LESS in your project:

```
app
 └ assets
    └ stylesheets
       └ main.less
       └ utils
          └ _reset.less
          └ _layout.less    
```

With the following `main.less` source:

```css
@import "utils/_reset.less";
@import "utils/_layout.less";

h1 {
    color: red;
}
```

The resulting CSS file will be compiled as `public/stylesheets/main.css`, and you can use this in your template as any regular public asset. A minified version will also be generated.

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="@routes.Assets.at("stylesheets/main.css")">
```

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="@routes.Assets.at("stylesheets/main.min.css")">
```

## Configuration

The default behavior of compiling every file that is not prepended by an underscore may not fit every project; for example if you include a library that has not been designed that way.

This can be configured in `project/Build.scala` by overriding the `lessEntryPoints` key. This key holds a `PathFinder`.

For example, to compile `app/assets/stylesheets/main.less` and nothing else:

```
 val main = PlayProject(appName, appVersion, mainLang = SCALA).settings(
   lessEntryPoints <<= baseDirectory(_ / "app" / "assets" / "stylesheets" ** "main.less")
 )
```
