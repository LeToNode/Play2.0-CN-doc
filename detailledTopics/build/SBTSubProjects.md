# Working with sub-projects

A complex project is not necessarily composed of a single Play application. You may want to split a large project into several smaller applications, or even extract some logic into a standard Java or Scala library that has nothing to do with a Play application.

It will be helpful to read the [SBT documentation on multi-project builds](https://github.com/harrah/xsbt/wiki/Getting-Started-Multi-Project).  Sub-projects do not have their own build file, but share the parent project's build file.

## Adding a simple library sub-project

You can make your application depend on a simple library project. Just add another sbt project definition in your `project/Build.scala` build file:

```
import sbt._
import Keys._
import PlayProject._

object ApplicationBuild extends Build {

  val appName         = "my-first-application"
  val appVersion      = "1.0"

  val appDependencies = Seq()
  
  val mySubProject = Project("my-library", file("modules/myLibrary"))

  val main = PlayProject(
    appName, appVersion, appDependencies
  ).dependsOn(mySubProject)
}
```

Here we have defined a sub-project in the application’s `modules/myLibrary` folder. This sub-project is a standard sbt project, using the default layout:

```
modules
 └ myLibrary
    └ src
       └ main
          └ java
          └ scala 
```

When you have a sub-project enabled in your build, you can focus on this project and compile, test or run it individually. Just use the `projects` command in the Play console prompt to display all projects:

```
[my-first-application] $ projects
[info] In file:/Volumes/Data/gbo/myFirstApp/
[info] 	 * my-first-application
[info] 	   my-library
```

To change the current project use the `project` command:

```
[my-first-application] $ project my-library
[info] Set current project to my-library
>
```

When you run your Play application in dev mode, the dependent projects are automatically recompiled, and if something cannot compile you will see the result in your browser:

## Splitting your web application into several parts

As a Play application is just a standard sbt project with a default configuration, it can depend on another Play application. 

The configuration is very close to the previous one. Simply configure your sub-project as a `PlayProject`:

```
import sbt._
import Keys._
import PlayProject._

object ApplicationBuild extends Build {

  val appName = "zenexity.com"
  val appVersion = "1.2"

  val common = PlayProject(
    appName + "-common", appVersion, path = file("modules/common")
  )
  
  val website = PlayProject(
    appName + "-website", appVersion, path = file("modules/website")
  ).dependsOn(common)
  
  val adminArea = PlayProject(
    appName + "-admin", appVersion, path = file("modules/admin")
  ).dependsOn(common)
  
  val main = PlayProject(
    appName, appVersion
  ).dependsOn(
    website, adminArea
  )
}
```

Here we define a complete project split in two main parts: the website and the admin area. Moreover these two parts depend themselves on a common module.
