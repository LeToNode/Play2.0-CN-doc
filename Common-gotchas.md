Please document your "wtf moments" here, to help other users avoid them.
When Play surprises you with a behavior you didn't expect or a yet unresolved bug, this is the place:

 - [Declare anonymous function in templates](https://github.com/playframework/Play20/wiki/Declare-anonymous-function-in-templates)
 - Be aware that calling public static controller methods will issue a redirect. Sometimes you just want to reuse a piece of logic between different actions - make sure to use private methods for this kind of logic sharing.

**This belongs to Play 1, and is actually off topic here (Play 2 wiki):**
(Just keeping it here because there's no Play 1 wiki. If you object, feel free to delete this entire section)

 - [Don't name any parameter to an action method "action"](https://play.lighthouseapp.com/projects/57987-play-framework/tickets/1381-enums-are-not-parsed-correctly-are-null-at-action-methods)
