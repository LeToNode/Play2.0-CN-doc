# Using the Play 2.0 console

## Launching the console

The Play 2.0 console is a development console based on sbt that allows you to manage a Play applicationâ€™s complete development cycle.

To launch the console, enter any existing Play application directory and run the `play` script:

```bash
$ cd /path/to/any/application
$ play 
```

## Getting help

Use the `help play` command to get basic help about the available commands:

```bash
[My first application] $ help play
```

## Running the server in development mode

To run the current application in development mode, use the `run` command:

```bash
[My first application] $ run
```

In this mode, the server will be launched with the auto-reload feature enabled, meaning that for each request Play will check your project and recompile required sources. If needed the application will restart automatically.

If there are any compilation errors you will see the result of the compilation directly in your browser:

To stop the server, type `Crtl+D` key, and you will be returned to the Play console prompt.

## Compiling

In Play 2.0 you can also compile your application without running the server. Just use the `compile` command:

```bash
[My first application] $ compile
```

## Launch the interactive console

Type `console` to enter the interactive Scala console, which allows you to test your code interactively:

```bash
[My first application] $ console
```

## Using sbt features

The Play console is just a normal sbt console, so you can use sbt features such as **triggered execution**. 

For example, using `~ compile`

```bash
[My first application] $ ~ compile
```

The compilation will be triggered each time you change a source file.

If you are using `~ run`

```bash
[My first application] $ ~ run
```

The triggered compilation will be enabled while a development server is running.

You can also do the same for `~ test`, to continuously test your project each time you modify a source file:

```bash
[My first application] $ ~ test
```

## Using the play commands directly

You can also run commands directly without entering the Play console. For example, enter `play run`:

```bash
$ play run
[info] Loading project definition from myFirstApp/project
[info] Set current project to My first application

--- (Running the application from SBT, auto-reloading is enabled) ---

[info] play - Listening for HTTP on port 9000...

(Server started, use Ctrl+D to stop and go back to the console...)
```

The application starts directly. When you quit the server using `Ctrl+D`, you will come back to your OS prompt.
